- Fixes edge promotion issues in JGraphFacade
- Adds Orthogonal edge router
- Adds constructor to facade taking GraphLayoutCache as parameter
- Adds deterministic flag to hierarchical layout to enable ordering
- Adds ordered variable to facade. This determines whether or not cells are
   ordered as their are found in the graph model. Note that prior to 1.3 the
   default behaviour was to always order cells. Ordering can cause quadratic
   performance under some circumstances and so is now turned off by default. If
   you are upgrading and relied on ordering being implicit, you need to call
   facade.setOrdered(true) to obtain the same behaviour.

16-JUL-2005: JGraph Layout Pro-1.2.0.1

- A non-linear performance method (JGraphFacade.getCell()) has been corrected
	to be linear performance. Users experiencing performance difficulties with
	using layouts on graph over 100 nodes in size should upgrade. Users not
	wishing to upgrade may wish to change the first line of getCell() if it
	reads:
			SortedSet result = new TreeSet(order);
	to:
			Set result = new LinkedHashSet();
	to fix the issue.
